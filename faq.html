              <h5 id="whoisitfor">Who is Stability for?</h5>
              <p> Stability is for anyone who wants to use it! People who might particularly want to use it include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>People who want a lot of control over how they visualize their fitness data.</li>
                <li>People who have a complicated relationship to food and/or exercise.</li>
                <li>People who don't want to look at overall trajectories without getting caught up on individual numbers.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Everyone has different health needs. I made Stability because my needs and the needs of people I care about weren't being served well by existing health and fitness apps. If you think Stability might meet your needs, give it a try!
              </p>
              <h5 id="datasecurity">Is my data safe?</h5>
              <p>
                The only data that Stability stores about you are your preferences (units, what graphs you want, settings for those graphs, etc.). We also use a secure id from Google to associate your preferences with your account. We do not store any of your health and fitness data. Since we don't have it, no one can steal it from us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Details: All of your health data is processed with client-side Javascript. That means it never goes to our servers. Your computer just calls up Google's servers directly, asks for your data, and does stuff to it. And, since Stability is 100% open source, you don't need to take our word for it - you can go <a href="https://github.com/emilydolson/stability"> look at the code </a> yourself.
              </p>
              <h5 id="safemode">What is safe mode?</h5>
              <p>
                For some people, seeing references to things like weight and calories can be damaging to mental health. Turning safe mode on hides all references to these concepts. It will not delete existing graphs (click the x in the upper right to do that), but it will remove the option to add y-axis labels to the weight graph if they aren't already present.
              </p>
              <p>
                Are there other things that you find triggering and would like to hide in safe mode? <a href="mailto:info@stability-app.com"> Let me know </a> and I'll add them.
              </p>

              <h5 id="featurereq"> I have a feature request! </h5>
              </p>
                Great! <a href="mailto:info@stability-app.com"> Let me know </a> and I'll see what I can do. Or better yet, if you can code, <a href="https://github.com/emilydolson/stability"> send me a pull request</a>.
              </p>
              <h5 id="whoareyou"> Who are you? </h5>
              <p>
                I'm a graduate student in computer science and biology. I have no particular expertise in fitness, and I firmly believe that if there were more female programmers, someone else would have already made a better version of this app. But I've been waiting for six years, now, so I finally decided to take matters into my own hands.
