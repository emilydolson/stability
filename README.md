# Stability

A non-judgmental fitness app that doesn't make assumptions about your health needs.

## Current features:

- Log-in with Google
- Pull your data from Google fit and graph trends
- Change settings on graphs

## Todo:

- Graph individual activities
- Have landing page
- Write explanatory text
- Add more options for what time unit to aggregate data by

## Note:

This is a major work in progress - I add a feature every time I get angry enough at all of the apps that currently exist. I make no promises of it being done any time soon (unless someone wants to help...).


Built with [material design lite](https://getmdl.io), [d3.js](https://d3js.org/), and [science.js](https://github.com/jasondavies/science.js).
