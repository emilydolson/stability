# Stability

A non-judgmental fitness app that doesn't make assumptions about your health needs.

## Current features:

- Log-in with Google
- Pull your weight data from Google fit and graph the trend

## Todo:

- All other data types
- Format website (probably split into multiple pages)
- Write explanatory text
- Add more options for what to show (numbers on graph)

## Note:

This is a major work in progress - I add a feature every time I get angry enough at all of the apps that currently exist. I make no promises of it being done any time soon (unless someone wants to help...).


Built with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [d3.js](https://d3js.org/), and [science.js](https://github.com/jasondavies/science.js).
